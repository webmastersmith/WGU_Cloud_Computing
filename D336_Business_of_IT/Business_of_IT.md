## 1.1 Syllabus listed definition (2 questions on ITIL 4 exam)

  - customer: takes a service, and uses it for their own purposes.
  - user: end user of service.
  - sponsor: provides the money.
  - e.g. purchase phone:
    - customer: takes phone and uses it to make calls, text...
    - user: end user of phone.
    - sponsor: pays for the monthly phone plan.
- **service**
  - A means of enabling value co-creation by **facilitating outcomes that customers wants**, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
  - The customer does not want to worry about how the service gets to them. customer doesn't care how the company manages risk, compliance..., they just want the service.

- **utility**
  - The **functionality** offered by a **product or service** to meet a particular need.

To have utility, a service must either support the performance of the consumer or remove constraints from the consumer. Many services do both.
- **warranty**
  - Assurance that a product or service will **meet agreed requirements**. Warranty can be summarized as ‘how the service performs’ and can be used to determine whether a service is ‘fit for use’. Warranty often relates to service levels aligned with the needs of service consumers. This may be based on a formal agreement, or it may be a marketing message or brand image. Warranty typically addresses such areas as the availability of the service, its capacity, levels of security, and continuity. A service may be said to provide acceptable assurance, or ‘warranty’, if all defined and agreed conditions are met.

    a. Service: A means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes that customers want to achieve, without the customer having to manage specific costs and risks.
    b. Service management: A set of specialized organizational capabilities for enabling value for customers in the form of services.
    c. Customer: The role that defines the requirements for a service and takes responsibility for the outcomes of service consumption.
    d. User: The role that uses services.
    e. Sponsor: The role that authorizes budget for service consumption. Can also be used to describe an organization or individual that provides financial or other support for an initiative.
    f. Utility: The functionality offered by a product or service to meet a particular need. Utility can be
    summarized as ‘what the service does’ and can be used to determine whether a service is ‘fit for purpose’. To have utility, a service must either support the performance of the consumer or remove constraints from the consumer. Many services do both.
    g. Warranty: Assurance that a product or service will meet agreed requirements. Warranty can be summarized as ‘how the service performs’ and can be used to determine whether a service is 'fit for use'. Warranty often relates to service levels aligned with the needs of service consumers. This may be based on a formal agreement, or it may be a marketing message or brand image. Warranty typically addresses such areas as the availability of the service, its capacity, levels of security, and continuity. A service may be said to provide acceptable assurance, or 'warranty', if all defined and agreed conditions are met.
