    - I hate reading course material. I just do. I end up zoning out. Quizlet on 'Learning' mode is my bread and butter. I'll watch videos on concepts I need clarification on, but I rely almost entirely on Quizlet. Though the Quizlet set created by Brian MacFarlane is long, it has questions from the exams in it verbatim. I firmly believe that if you review the 4 sets below, you'll be ready for the exam.

  - no party to a **transaction** can later **claim** that **they did not take part**.
- **Randomization**
  - replacing data with random values. While it obscures the original data, it might not be effective in preventing the identification of individuals if other related data points remain unchanged.
- **Single sign-on (SSO)**
  - SSO simplifies the login process for users across **multiple applications**.
  - (e.g. sign-in Microsoft Office, use One Note, Word, Excel...).

## Threats

- **Broken Authentication**
  - auth issues allowing exploiting permissions.
- **Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - when an **application allows untrusted data** to be sent to a **web browser** without proper validation or escaping.
  - **Injection**
    - malicious attempt to run unauthorized code or action by injecting a string value into a field. (e.g. SQL, LDAP, OS).
    - malicious user attempts to **inject a string of some type into a field** in order to manipulate the application’s actions to **reveal unauthorized data**. SQL, LDAP, or OS injections.
- **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
  - manipulates a **logged-on user’s browser** to send a **forged HTTP request** along with **valid cookies** to generate a request that a vulnerable **application thinks is legitimate**.
  - **Tokens**: used to prevent CSRF attack.
- **Honeypot**
  - tool used to detect, identify, isolate, and analyze attacks by distracting attackers (usually a dummy machine with useless data).
- **Insecure Direct Object Access**
  - user can manipulates data by referencing an internal object without access controls.
- **OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities**
  1. [**Broken Access Control**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/): using insecure direct object identifiers to view another user's account information.
  2. [**cryptographic Failures**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/): sensitive data exposure or system compromise.
  3. [**Injection**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/): Cross-site Scripting.
  4. [**Insecure Design**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/): lack of business risk profiling.
  5. [**Security Misconfiguration**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/): some form of misconfiguration.
  6. [**Vulnerable and Outdated Components**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/): test and assess risk.
  7. [**Identification and Authentication Failures**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/): session management.
  8. [**Software and Data Integrity Failures**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/): software updates, critical data, and CI/CD pipelines without verifying integrity.
  9. [**Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/): impact visibility, incident alerting, and forensics.
  10. [**Server-Side Request Forgery**](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/): fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**
  - exposure of PII, credit card, medical...
