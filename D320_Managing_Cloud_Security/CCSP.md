  - I hate reading course material. I just do. I end up zoning out. Quizlet on 'Learning' mode is my bread and butter. I'll watch videos on concepts I need clarification on, but I rely almost entirely on Quizlet. Though the Quizlet set created by Brian MacFarlane is long, it has questions from the exams in it verbatim. I firmly believe that if you review the 4 sets below, you'll be ready for the exam.

- **WGU Chatter**
  - paid special attention to Chapter 4 which focused on Security aspects.
  - pros and cons of the different cloud types; Private, Public, Community, etc. Be familiar with what is offered through IaaS, PaaS, etc, and what risks are involved with each type.
  - different laws that pertain to the cloud.
