  - I'd say **study the PA extensively** as the OA is very similar with some questions verbatim.
  - Just study the **bolded terms** in the book and the **acronyms**, the other half of the exam is literally common sense.
  - **LowPowerWAN "LPWAN"** there were like 3-6 questions on that alone, make sure you know your **regs** and what they do like **NIST, ICT**, etc.
  - The **most important part of the book was the last 4 chapters**, the ones that talked about IoT in transportation, healthcare, agriculture (specifically the difference between sensors, actuators, etc), and the ethical concerns and standards behind IoT. Those 4 chapters make up at least 50% of the exam.
  - few questions about **botnets** and the **Mirai Malware**.
  - The only thing they really want you to know is that the **malware specifically attacks devices with default credentials**.
  - They hit **Blockchain** pretty hard in the OA too so I'd study up on how a blockchain operates, but if you've taken the Intro to Crypto course before this you will have no problem in that section.

## 05_Three main aspects of interoperability: discovery, access control, and usage

- **Discovery**
  - Where information is distributed across many aggregators (IoT platforms), it is necessary to first identify which aggregators contain information of interest and afterwards find specific data sets.
- **Access control**
  - In the more open environment of the IoT, a provider of information generally does not know all potential consumers of its data. Facilities that allow information providers to retain control over access should therefore be provided by an IoT platform.
- **Data access**
  - The primary aim of the data access platform is to reduce the technical barriers faced by both providers and consumers of information in which they have a shared interest. This particularly applies to where they have different starting points and thus do not have an existing shared context.

Verifying data from sensors by a central authority
  - **Correct Answer**
    - **Providing a single version of the truth across all sensor data**: In an IoT application where multiple sensors collect the same data, there might be slight variations in readings due to factors like sensor calibration or environmental conditions. The consensus mechanism within the blockchain ensures that all participating nodes in the network agree on a single version of the data to be added to the blockchain. This agreement helps establish a verifiable and tamperproof record of the sensor data, eliminating discrepancies and providing a single source of truth.
  - **Incorrect Answer**
    - **Ensuring that data from each sensor is treated equally**: While the consensus mechanism promotes fairness within the network, its primary purpose isn't to give equal weight to every sensor's data point (which might have slight variations). It focuses on agreeing on a single, verifiable data record.
    - **Identifying a single sensor with the most accurate data**: The consensus mechanism doesn't determine which sensor is **most accurate.** It validates the data and reaches an agreement on a single version to be recorded. Data analysis techniques might be used later to assess sensor accuracy based on specific criteria.
    - **Verifying data from sensors by a central authority**: Blockchain is inherently decentralized, meaning there's no central authority verifying data. The consensus mechanism involves distributed verification among multiple nodes within the network.
