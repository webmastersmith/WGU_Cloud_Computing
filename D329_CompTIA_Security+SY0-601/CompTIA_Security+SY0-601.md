- **Predictability**: Predictable patterns or repetitions in data can weaken cryptographic protections, as attackers may exploit these patterns to gain insights or break encryption.
- **Reuse**: Reusing cryptographic keys or initialization vectors in multiple instances or sessions can lead to security vulnerabilities if one instance is compromised, affecting the security of others.
- **Entropy**: Insufficient randomness or entropy during key generation can result in keys that are easier to predict or crack, reducing the overall security of the cryptographic system.
- **Computational Overheads**: Cryptographic operations can consume significant computational resources, including CPU power and memory, potentially affecting the performance of devices or systems.
- **Resource vs. Security Constraints**: Balancing the need for security with resource constraints, such as limited processing power or memory in IoT devices, can be challenging. Sometimes, resource limitations necessitate compromises in cryptographic strength.
