  - **CompTIA Four Steps of Change Control**
    1. Initiate the request
    2. Evaluate impacts
    3. Decide on an outcome
    4. Implement the change
- **The change request process uses two documents**
  - **change request form**: information about change(project name, date, description, reason...).
  - **change log**: all change request for project.
  - ![change request form](img/Change-Request.jpg)
- **Initiate the request**
  - requester initiates by submitting a **change request form** to the project manager.
- **Evaluate impacts**
  - conduct a thorough impact assessment.
  - analyze how the change will effect the project’s constraints: **scope, cost and time**.
  - PM will create an information package outlining the change request, schedule changes, scope changes, risks, resource requirements, and notable impacts.
  - PM will document change recommendations directly in the **change log**.
- **Decide on an outcome**
  - identify and get sign-off from the decision makers(authority to make change).
    - Operational Change: little impact. Normal day-to-day business. PM, functional manager, or CCB.
    - Strategic Change: effects all aspects of business. project sponsor, CCB, and PMO.
    - Risk Owner: If risk is involved, risk owner will contribute to decision.
    - Technical Changes: SMEs will be involved in decision.

  - Critical Path Method: finding the longest stretch to dependencies(sequential activities).
  - exposes task that risk missing the finish date.
  - Three things needed:
    - list of all project task.
    - project dependencies.
    - time each task will take.
- **Scheduling: Calculate Critical Path**
  - which path adds up to the longest. Any delay will result in missing the finish date.

    - Strengths: Positive internal factors that give the project an advantage.
    - Weaknesses: Negative internal factors that hinder the project's success.
    - Opportunities: External factors that can be leveraged to benefit the project.
    - Threats: External factors that could negatively impact the project.
  - It can be applied to various aspects of a project, including resource allocation, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.
  - Project managers should consider both quantitative and qualitative factors when performing a SWOT analysis.
  - The results of a SWOT analysis should be documented and communicated to stakeholders.
- **Contingency Planning**
  - if initial risk plan fails, fallback plan to mitigate risk.
- **Transition Plan: Operational Training, Go Live, Operational Handoff, Internal and External Audience**
  - Transition Plan: project is transferred within organization to functional group or outside organization.
  - Operational Training: education to use, maintain, product long term.
  - Go Live: project moves from test environment to production.
  - Operational Handoff: transition work to permanent owners. They will oversee day-to-day activities.

  - Iteration: short term planning cycle.
  - Program Increment: longer-term planning cycle.
- **SAFe Strengths**
  - allows scaling and project organization in bigger organizations with multiple agile teams.
- **SAFe Weakness**
  - adds layers of overhead to organization.
- **SAFe Use**
  - multiple agile teams that need to collaborate more effectively.

## Scrum

- **Scrum**
  - iterative and incremental agile framework doing short sprints and team collaboration with daily stand-ups.
  - emphasizes empiricism(**learn from doing not just guessing**) and lean thinking(**focus on value**), promoting continual improvement.
  - Scrum is an **all-or-nothing framework**, requiring the use of all its parts for optimal results.
  - It introduces roles like the Scrum team(3-9 members), product owner(backlog owner), Scrum master(implement scrum principles), and developers(remaining team).
  - Self organized, self directed. Flexible, Daily Stand-ups, short sprints(each deliver a project. ~1 week)
- **Scrum 5 Values**
  - Commitment, focus, openness, respect, courage.
- **Scrum 3 Pillars**
  - Transparency(clear goals), inspection(asses work), adaptation(make adjustments from feedback).
- **Scrum Events**
  - Sprint: iteration and all scrum events.
  - Epic: large project
  - User Stories: smaller units of work stored in the backlog.
  - Backlog: list of all the work that needs to be done in order to complete the project. User Stories are stored, higher is more priority.
  - Sprint planning: backlog created.
  - Daily Scrum: review progress, plan next 24 hours(daily stand-up).
  - Sprint review: uncover issues early, confirm on track.
  - Sprint retrospective: find improvement opportunities(improve scrum flow) from previous sprint.
- **Scrum Key Artifacts**
  - Product Backlog: list of changes.
  - Product Goal: long term target.
  - Sprint Backlog: plan for upcoming sprint.
  - Sprint Goal: summarize value of sprint.
  - Increment: meets the 'done' definition and move to next product goal.
- **Scrum Strengths**
  - short cycles allow responsive learning, complex problem solving fro unpredictable work.
- **Scrum Weakness**
  - teams must be highly cohesive, cross-functional. No large groups.

## Software Development Lifecycle SDLC

- **SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)**
  - produce high-quality, low-cost, thoroughly tested software.
- **SDLC 7 phases**
  1. Planning: outline project scope and purpose.
  2. Requirements: define resources needed and software purpose.
  3. Design & Prototyping: specifications of software: language, security, interface.
  4. Development: write code.
  5. Testing: software compatibility and performs as expected.
  6. Deployment: deploy to production environment.
  7. Operations and Maintenance: support software.
- **SDLC Waterfall Model**
  - sequential model, good for short task or well defined, no change projects.
- **SDLC Iterative Model**
  - hybrid. combines iterative with sequential models.
- **SDLC Spiral Model**
  - risk-centric iterative model.
  - most complex and resource-intensive model. Projects can 'spiral' out of control with cost and scope.
- **SDLC Agile Model**
  - similar to iterative model, but with more customer feedback.
  - helps with fast time-to-market projects.
- **SDLC Strengths**
  - comprehensive framework.
- **SDLC Weaknesses**
  - project success depends on time spent on advanced planning.

## System Development Life Cycle SDLC

- SDLC
  - classic way of looking at system and development.
  - planning -> analysis -> design -> implementation -> maintenance.

## Waterfall

- **Waterfall**
  - follows linear sequence. Work only flows one way. Teams any size.
  - documentation heavy. Steps known in advance. Scope and deliverables defined in advance.
  - Regular on/off boarding(highly specialized members flow in and out of project as needed).
  - Resources are typically fixed(backend, get python developer).
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks work into smaller units.
- **Waterfall 6 phases**
  1. requirements: project requirements.
  2. design: actionable specifications.
  3. implementation: do work.
  4. testing: verify.
  5. delivery: deploy to customer.
  6. maintenance: customer support.
- **Waterfall Communication: Stakeholder, Customer, Changes**
  - Stakeholder: provides comprehensive requirements at start, then review finished product.
  - Customer: customer does not communicate with developer.
  - Communication Changes: very few changes.
- **Waterfall Requirements**
  - requirements dictate how the project looks and behaves.
  - requirements must all be stated at start of project.
  - Collection of Requirements -> Product Creation -> Customer Review -> Maintenance Phase(fix after customer review).
- **Waterfall Budget and Schedule**
  - Budget: fixed, strict, predictable. Good for 'limited' budget.
  - Schedule: predictable. Entire project is planned in advance.
- **Waterfall Environmental Factors: Culture, Development Processes, Industry Standards**
  - Culture: favors vast knowledge and role specialization.
  - Development Processes: customer receives finished product.
  - Industry Standards: linear and sequential. Heavy documentation.
- **Waterfall Use**
  - when you have clear objectives, heavy documentation, and high change cost.

## Work Breakdown Structure

- **WBS**
  - waterfall way of breaking down large projects into deliverables.
  - find the Business **WHAT** not the 'how'. What do we need?
  - find Functional Requirements: what does the project need to do?
  - find Non-Functional Requirements: color, size...
  - project charter -> scope statement -> business,functional,non-functional -> WBS.
  - **Purpose**:
    - The structure helps identify all necessary tasks and ensures no crucial work is missed.
    - It facilitates work estimation and resource allocation based on the size and complexity of each unit.
    - each level of the WBS clarifies the work required at that level.
    - lower levels provide more detail and granularity on how the higher-level work will be accomplished.
  - **Creation Process**:
    - Determine Scope: review Statement of Work (SOW), Business 'WHAT', Function/Non-Functional requirements.
    - Each WBS Level: brief description, resources, cost, time.
      - WBS Level 1: Project (totality of entire project)
    - Identify deliverables, team members, resources.
      - WBS Level 2: Main catagories. Breaks down the project into major deliverables or phases.
      - WBS Level 3: Further breaks down each deliverable/phase into smaller sub-deliverables/sub-phases.
      - WBS Level 4 on onward: breaking down units of work until you reach the level of **Work Packages**.
  - ![wbs2](img/wbs2.jpg)
- **Creating the Work Package**
  - work package (WP): requirements are decomposed until time and money can be accurately estimated.
  - decomposing. Breaking each requirement into smaller and smaller manageable pieces.
- **WBS vs Backlog**
  - WBS assumes that scope, time, and cost are fixed and works to control them.
  - WBS has more structure than a backlog in its design. The WBS has specific numbering conventions and design rules, including MECE and the 100% rule.

|                         | WBS               | Project Backlog             | Product Backlog              |
| :---------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Duration                | Length of project | Length of project           | As long as product is viable |
| Scope                   | Fixed             | Flexible                    | Flexible                     |
| Resources               | Fixed             | Fixed                       | Fixed                        |
| Time                    | Fixed             | Fixed                       | Fixed                        |
| Deliverable or Activity | Deliverable       | Deliverable                 | Deliverable                  |
| Hierarchy               | Numbered Levels   | Epic > Feature > User Story | Epic > Feature > User Story  |
| When Created            | Planning Phase    | All Phases                  | Entire Life Cycle            |

- **WBS Dictionary, Work Package, Task**
  - Dictionary: itemized list with id number. Includes more information about item.
    - ![wbs](img/wbs2.jpg)
    - ![wbs dictionary](img/Work-Breakdown-Structure-Dictionary.webp)
  - Work Package: one or more deliverables that need to be created together.
    - collectively develop deliverable.
  - Task: many little activities to create the project.
- **WBS MECE**
  - Mutually Exclusive: no overlaps. each label no repeated.
  - Collectively Exhaustive: Together, all work packages encompass the entire project.
- **WBS Rules**
  - can estimate cost, time, resources.
  - 8/80. Element should last at least 8hrs but no more than 80hrs.
  - will fit in reporting period(report on project status).
  - produces measurable deliverable.
  - breaking down further wouldn't help project.
