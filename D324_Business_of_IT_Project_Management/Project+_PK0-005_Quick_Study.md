  - The **process of how change is brought up and put into play**. Know every. single. step. front and back, had a lot of questions regarding what to be done after a certain step
  - Know what happens during all the **steps of a project beginning with Initiation all the way to Closing**.
  - Know differences and **characteristic between functional, projectized, matrix structures**. Given a scenario, be able to say "this is a functional structure" or "this is projectized", etc.
  - Really know the different **roles**, what they can and cant do.
  - What encompasses the charter, scope, WBS.
  - Know the different **risk strategies** and be able to assign them to an example (accept, mitigate, transfer, avoid, exploit).
  - Know the different **communication methods**, I had a ton of these which kind of surprised me. Know which one is appropriate for certain scenarios (this was a very annoying part of the test because the questions didn't have much context at all so I really had to guess at times)
  - I memorized the formulas for **CV, SV, CPI, SPI and literally had 0 questions** on them which was unfortunate, I know some people get questions on them so may be valuable for you. Wasn't for me

## Project Phases

1. Initiating Phase

   1. Identifying project needs
   2. defining project objectives
   3. conducting feasibility studies
   4. creating a project charter
   5. securing stakeholder buy-in
   6. identifying risks and assumptions.

2. Planning Phase:

   - documents that describes what the team will deliver and how they will deliver them.
     - Scope Statement
     - WBS or Backlog
     - Resource Plan
     - Project Schedule (Gantt chart, PERT chart)
     - Quality Management Plan
     - Risk Management Plan
     - Communication Plan
     - Stakeholder Management Plan
     - Project Baseline
     - Project Budget
     - Project Plan Approval.

3. Executing Phase:

   - where work is performed, monitored, and tracked. If product does not conform, change request are created.
     - Producing and verifying deliverables
     - Implementing change management
     - Managing vendors
     - Tracking and reporting project results
     - Updating project elements such as budget, risk, and timelines

     - Monitoring the risks and issues log
     - Performing quality assurance/governance activities such as coordinating phase gate reviews
     - Monitoring the budget
     - Conducting project meetings and updates

4. Closing Phase:

   - project closeout. contracts closed, team members released.
   - Project teams can use **organizational change management (OCM)** to reduce the strain caused by change.
   - validate deliverables, document acceptance of project work.
     - Validating deliverables
     - Closing contracts
     - Removing access
     - Releasing resources

     - Handing off the product to the organization
     - Evaluating the project
     - Archiving project documents
     - Rewards and celebration

## Charts

## Change Control Steps

- The change request process uses two documents:
  - **change request form**: information about change(project name, date, description, reason...).
  - **change log**: all change request for project.
  - mnemonic: Initiate Examine Decide Integrate.

1. Initiate the request
   1. requester initiates by submitting a **change request form** to the project manager.
2. Evaluate impacts
   1. conduct a thorough impact assessment.
   2. analyze how the change will effect the project’s **resources, budget, scope, and schedule**.
   3. PM will create an information package outlining the change request, schedule changes, scope changes, risks, resource requirements, and notable impacts.
   4. PM will document change recommendations directly in the **change log**.
3. Decide on an outcome
   1. identify and get sign-off from the decision makers(authority to make change).
      1. Operational Change: little impact. Normal day-to-day business. PM, functional manager, or CCB.
      2. Strategic Change: effects all aspects of business. project sponsor, CCB, and PMO.
      3. Risk Owner: If risk is involved, risk owner will contribute to decision.
      4. Technical Changes: SMEs will be involved in decision.
      5. Software Changes: Technical, Product Owner, and Architectural approval is needed.
4. Implement the change
   1. Communicate Change: stakeholders, project requester, team.
   2. Update project plan and if needed the RACI, business case, or stakeholder management plan.
   3. Capture the project **baselines before and after** changing the project plan.
   4. Validate Change:
      1. Project manager: evaluates impact and verifies if as expected.
      2. Change Requester: validates results meet requirements.
      3. Change Reviewer: compare outcome against business requirements. In agile its product owner. could also be SME or functional manager.
   5. PM notifies stakeholders of completed change.
   6. Update status in change log.

## Other

1. Identify and document the change:

   Clearly define the proposed change, including its impact on scope, schedule, budget, quality, and risk.
   Document the rationale behind the change and who is proposing it.

2. Submit the change request:

   Follow established procedures for submitting change requests, typically through a dedicated form or system.
   Ensure all necessary information is provided for proper evaluation.
   Change control board is used by many companies.

3. Evaluate the change request:

   A designated team or individual assesses the potential impact of the change on various aspects of the project.
   This evaluation considers factors like feasibility, cost, benefits, resource availability, and alignment with project goals.

4. Decision and approval:

   Based on the evaluation, a decision is made to approve, reject, or defer the change.
   Approval usually comes from a pre-defined authority based on the significance of the change.
   Communication of the decision to all stakeholders is crucial.

5. Implement the change:

   If approved, the change is implemented according to a defined plan.
   This might involve updating project documents, communicating adjustments to the team, and allocating necessary resources.

6. Document and monitor:

   Change Control Log.
   All approved changes and their implementation details are documented for future reference and audit purposes.
   The impact of the change is monitored to ensure it aligns with expectations and doesn't lead to unintended consequences.
