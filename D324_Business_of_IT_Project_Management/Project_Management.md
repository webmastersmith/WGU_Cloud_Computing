## 1.01 Explain the basic CHARACTERISTICS of a PROJECT and various METHODOLOGIES and FRAMEWORKS used in IT projects

- Characteristics of a project::Start and finish
  - Start and Finish: Every project has a defined beginning and end, with measurable deliverables.
  - Every project must meet three criteria: it is unique, has a specific reason or purpose, and is temporary, meaning it must have a start and finish.
- Characteristics of a project::Unique
  - Unique: Each project is distinct, with specific goals, requirements, and resources.
- Characteristics of a project::Reason/purpose
  - Reason/Purpose: A project addresses a particular need or solves a problem, aiming to achieve a valuable outcome.
- Characteristics of a project::Project as part of a program
  - Project as part of a Program: Programs group related projects that collectively contribute to a broader strategic objective.
  - A program gathers several related projects to accomplish a big goal. Programs last longer than projects because they **run from the start of the first project to the end of the last project**.
  - You must collaborate with other project teams and the program manager.
  - You need to ensure your deliverables and schedule align with the program's plan and requirements.
- Characteristics of a project::Project as part of a portfolio
  - Project as part of a Portfolio: A portfolio **manages all the organization's projects**, balancing resources and optimizing their contribution to **strategic goals**.
  - The main **difference between portfolios and programs** is that **projects within a program are related to the program's objective**. Projects **within a portfolio do not need to be related**; they share a portfolio because they exist in the same arbitrary group of approved projects.
- Methodologies and frameworks::DevSecOps
  - DevSecOps: Integrates security considerations into the entire software development lifecycle.
- Methodologies and frameworks::DevOps
  - DevOps: Promotes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams to streamline software delivery.
- Methodologies and frameworks::Kanban
  - Kanban: Uses a visual kanban board to track task flow and optimize workflow.
  - **Main Focus:** Control work in progress (WIP) levels and manage workflows.
  - 6 Core Practices:
    1. Visualize work: Use a Kanban board to track work progress through stages.
    2. Limit WIP: Reduce context switching and increase focus by restricting active tasks.
    3. Make policies explicit: Define rules for moving work through stages for clarity.
    4. Manage flow: Identify and eliminate workflow bottlenecks for efficiency.
    5. Implement feedback loops: Measure workflow performance and use data for improvement.
    6. Improve collaboratively: Experiment and continuously evolve the workflow.
  - Key Features:
    - Kanban board: Visualizes work, WIP limits, and workflow policies.
    - 3 basic phases: To Do, In Progress, Done (can be customized).
    - 4-part workflow: Prioritize backlog, pull work into progress, move through phases, start new work.
  - Strengths:
    - Simple to learn, flexible, applicable to any industry.
    - Lightweight, focuses on routine work and clear policies.
  - Weaknesses:
    - Requires stable work environment, can struggle with large teams or high turnover.
    - Cycle times may lengthen without set iterations and proper performance management.
  - Use Cases:
    - Teams with frequently changing backlogs (e.g., ticketing systems)
    - Teams comfortable with less structure and stable workflows.
- Methodologies and frameworks::PrRojects IN Controlled Environments (PRINCE2)
  - PRINCE2: A structured project management methodology emphasizing control and accountability.
- Methodologies and frameworks::Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
  - SDLC: Defines a standardized approach to software development, guiding the process from planning to deployment.
- Methodologies and frameworks::Scrum
  - **Scrum**: An iterative and incremental agile framework emphasizing short sprints and team collaboration.
  - **Main Focus:** Delivering a potentially shippable product at the end of each iteration (sprint).
  - Most common agile framework. Scrum **helps teams learn and get better by doing things and not just guessing**.
  - The framework emphasizes empiricism and lean thinking, promoting continual improvement.
  - Scrum is an all-or-nothing framework, requiring the use of all its parts for optimal results.
  - It introduces roles like the Scrum team, product owner, Scrum master, and developers.
  - Key Concepts:
    - **Empiricism**: Decisions based on what is seen and known.
    - **Lean thinking**: Minimize waste and inefficiency
    - **All-or-nothing framework**: Use all elements or it's not Scrum

  - Process:
    - Product owner prioritizes work in product backlog.
    - Team selects top items for sprint backlog.
    - Team reviews results and adapts for next sprint.
    - Repeat until backlog is empty.
  - Roles:
    - Scrum Team: Delivers increments of value (3-10 members)
    - Product Owner: Owns and manages product backlog
    - Scrum Master: Coaches team and improves Scrum usage
    - Developers: Complete backlog items (not limited to software)

  - Use Cases:
    - Highly cohesive, cross-functional teams
    - Large, complex projects with unpredictable workflows
    - Adaptable projects with unknown requirements
- Methodologies and frameworks::Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)
  - **Agile**: Iterative and Incremental Development(IID). Features are completed and released often throughout the project.
    - Software development typically benefits from this type of framework. Constant feedback from incremental builds, help deliver an improved final product.
    - Strengths: expected change.
    - Weakness: scope creep creating missed deadlines.
    - Use: project requirements will change often. Team is stable and self organized.
  - **SAFe**: Scaled Agile Framework for large-scale agile projects, adapting agile principles to enterprise teams.
- Methodologies and frameworks::Extreme programming (XP)
  - XP: Extreme Programming emphasizes close collaboration, iterative development, and continuous testing.

  - Waterfall: A linear, sequential methodology and project framework where phases follow a strict order, like planning, design, development, testing, and deployment.
  - Strengths: simplest, easy to learn and use.
  - Weakness: not flexible. Change, starts project over from beginning(expensive).
  - Use: when you have fixed requirements, no unknowns, and high change cost.

## 1.02 Compare and contrast AGILE vs. WATERFALL concepts
